# PasswordGenerator
## Description
There are many different sites that ask you to make a password to create an account and it is common knowledge that it is not safe to use the same password for every site. Common words and phrases are easily crackable as well. Therefore in the interest of security it would be best to have a random Password. This is a generator of random passwords. WARNING: This is not crptographically secure, however will suffice for most user's usecase.
